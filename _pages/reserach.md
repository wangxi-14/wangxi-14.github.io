## First-order algorithm for Riemannian online optimization  
We consider the online optimization on Riemannian manifolds in the full information setting, 
where a learner sequentially interacts with the environment by observing function values or gradients on a Riemannian manifold.  
The goal is to minimize the regret of the learner, which measures the deviation of the learner's performance from the optimal solution.
