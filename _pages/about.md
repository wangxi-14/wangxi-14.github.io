My name is **Xi Wang (王溪)**. I am a Ph.D. candidate in Operational Research and Control Theory, at the [Academy of Mathematics and Systems Science](http://english.amss.cas.cn/), Chinese Academy of Sciences, under the supervision of Professor [Yiguang Hong](http://lsc.amss.ac.cn/~yghong/index.html). Prior to this, I obtained Bachelor's degree in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics from the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences in 2018. I am now a visiting student at the [Australian Centre for Field Robotics](https://www.sydney.edu.au/engineering/our-research/robotics-and-intelligent-systems/australian-centre-for-field-robotics.html), University of Sydney, under the supervision of Associate Professor [Guodong Shi](https://www.sydney.edu.au/engineering/about/our-people/academic-staff/guodong-shi.html).

Research Insterest
======

My research interests primarily focus on Riemannian optimization. Riemannian optimization utilizes the inherent geometric properties of Riemannian manifolds to develop algorithms that address the challenges posed by non-Euclidean data, which has fruitful applications in machine learning, computer vision, and bioinformatics.

In my future research, I am dedicated to further exploring optimization, game theory, and learning theory on geodesically curved spaces. Additionally, I aspire to leverage the theories to enhance the capabilities of artificial intelligence systems, robotics technologies, and control systems.
